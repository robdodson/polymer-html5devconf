Warning: We're going to talk about design
Warning: We're going to talk about code
We're in the multi-device era
We have to think in components
We have to evolve our process
  If
  Style Tiles
    - Start at the sketch level, increase fidelity over time
    - "[Style tiles are] a catalyst for discussions around the preferences and goals of the client."
  Element Collages
    - "That particular phrase creates an expectation that what we’re looking at isn’t a final design but rather an assembly of disparate pieces without specific logic or order"
    - Break designs apart into components, move those to a living style guide
  Living style guide
    - Anna Debenham, 24ways
      - easier to test
      - better workflow
      - shared vocabulary
      - useful reference
      - http://gim.ie/fZyK
    - Atomic Design / PatternLab
      - "Pattern Lab is a collection of tools to help create and maintain atomic web design systems"
      - "NOT a UI framework"
    - http://sfdc-styleguide.herokuapp.com/?id=isv#
      - Calendar example
But building UI for the web is getting really weird and complex...
  Can we make it even faster to build for multi-device land
    - Well... there was a time when you could crank out a website in like 5 minutes...
  What did it used to be like?
    - old school html
    - this was awesome!
  What's it like now?
    - Crazy JS land
      - This pushes designers and developers apart
      - Starting to hear "The designers design in code... then we throw it away!"
  Web Components!
    - What it is
    - The specs
  Polymer!
    - Enabling Web Components today!
    - Includes building blocks to get you rolling
    - Demo how you create your own stuff
Living style guides revisited
  Polymer version is super easy to reason about
  Lower cost to build prototypes
    - Finding a lot of success here
    - brings the team together
    - test the effectiveness of what you're building
    - design and iterate
    - test variations
    - real codez
    - pattern lab -> designer
Potentially share stuff
  - crazy idea! i kno!
  - benefits of sharing components
    - they get more robust
    - they look the same on the outside
    - less wasted effort
    - constant stress testing
